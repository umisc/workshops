# MISC Workshops 2020

Slides used in the workshops can be found here. Additional notes and files may also be added for each workshop as needed

Challenges should be live at https://workshop-ctf.umisc.info most of the time during the semester. Challenge files and writeups will be posted a couple of days after each workshop. Make sure you have a proper attempt at a challenge before looking at the writeup!
