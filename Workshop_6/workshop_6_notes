Task 1:
Cracking password using Hashcat 

1) CREATING A TEST USER: 
open terminal and create a new user who's password we will try to crack. Commands: 
    adduser "name" (For example we'll use user1)
    password: "password" (For the sake of simplicty and time efficiency we'll be using a simple passphrase like 'password' or 123456)
    
   After enterring the password, hit Enter for the rest of the fields and it'll choose the default option.
   
2) VIEWING THE HASH PASSWORD: In a Terminal window, execute this command:

    tail /etc/shadow 

The last line shows the password hash for our user. (everyone's hash will be different)
Look at the salt following the username "user1". The $6$ value indicates a type 6 password hash (SHA-512, many rounds). 

3) Identifying the hash type: The hash algorithm is defined in the file /etc/login.defs. To see the portion of that file 
discussing the password hash algorithm, execute this grep command to see 18 lines after the line containing the string "ENCRYPT_METHOD":

    grep -A 18 ENCRYPT_METHOD /etc/login.defs 

4) MAKING A HASH FILE:  
In the Terminal window, execute these commands:

    tail -n 1 /etc/shadow > crack1.hash
    
    nano crack1.hash 

In the nano text editor, carefully delete the username jose and the colon after it, and delete everything after the semicolon
at the end of the file, 
including all the colons.

5) DOWNLOADING THE WORD-LIST:
We'll use a very small list of 500 common passwords.

In a Terminal window, execute these commands:

     curl https://samsclass.info/123/proj10/500_passwords.txt > 500_passwords.txt 

To view the first 10 entries of the file, type in the following command: 
    head 500_passwords.txt 
    
6) CRACKING THE HASH:
In the Terminal window, execute these commands:

     hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 -o found1.txt --remove crack1.hash 500_passwords.txt

    Explanation: This uses hashcat with these options:
    
    Unix type 6 password hashes (-m 1800)
    Using a dictionary attack (-a 0)
    Putting output in the file found1.txt
    Removing each hash as it is found (--remove)
    Getting hashes from crack1.hash
    Using the dictionary 500_passwords.txt 
    
7) VIEWING THE PASSWORD:    
    cat found1.txt
    
    You should see the hash, with the cracked password of "password" at the end separated by a semicolon.
